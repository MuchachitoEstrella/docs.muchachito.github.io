### a documentation of my Website Project

This document describes the outcome of creating a website that was uploaded on YouTube on November 10, 2010. The video can be found [Here](https://youtu.be/TycGBKWdsiM). The website was a personal experiment to prank the internet users by redirecting them to different websites when they clicked on various images. The website also contained a hidden rickroll that would play when the user clicked on a troll face image.

### Website Design and Features

The website was created using a simple VS Code that allowed the creator to customize the layout, colors, fonts, and images of the website (though I didn't focus on that). The website had a white background and a white heading that said “Heading”. The website contained several images that were not randomly arranged, but not in any specific order on the page. Some of the images were related to the creator’s interests, such as music, gaming, and memes. Some of the images were unrelated or nonsensical, such as a Prime, Blockbench (removed).

The main feature of the website was that each image had a different hyperlink that would redirect the user to another website when they clicked on it. Some of the websites were harmless or funny, such as The ones made by me, Roblox, or Amazon. The websites made by me were all (at the time) music related apart from blockbench (removed), The most notable website was the one that was linked to the troll face image, which was a rickroll that would play the song “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Ashley (which I am now realizing it's spelled Astley) and display the lyrics of the song.

### Website Video

The website was uploaded on YouTube as a video that showed the creator opening the website and clicking on the troll face image. The video was intended to be a prank to the viewers and to the internet users who would visit the website.

The website was not very useful, informative, or attractive. I have made better websites, but as my dad described it, that one is the only one with my touch added to it. The website did not have a clear purpose, audience, or message. The website was only a prank that did not have any lasting value or impact. The website was not a good example of a web design or a web development project, it was fun to make as my second ever website.

### Credit

I would also like to give some credit to "Bro Codez" on YouTube for teaching me HTML and allowing me to make that troll website.
